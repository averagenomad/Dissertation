**Multidisciplinary Approach to Civil Conflict: Political, Economic, and Social Determinants of Violence**  
*Claremont Graduate University, 2023*  

Civil conflict is more abundant and generally less severe than interstate war, yet it remains a pressing issue worldwide. This dissertation adopts a **unified multidisciplinary framework** to examine the political, economic, and social determinants of civil conflict across 162 countries from 1991–2018. It explores factors influencing the **onset, severity, and duration of violence** as well as the **frequency of nonviolent protests**, incorporating both exogenous variables and the impact of prior conflict history.  

### **Key Contributions**  
- Unified analysis combining **political capacity, repression, regime type, income equality, gender inequality**, and **transnational diffusion of violence**.  
- Econometric modeling using Probit and Fixed Effects Regressions with Panel-Corrected Standard Errors.  
- Regional analysis across **seven geographic regions** to identify context-specific drivers and policy levers.  
- Findings underscore the importance of **prevention** and the limited tools available once violence begins, with nuanced regional differences.  

The full dissertation is **publicly available via Claremont Graduate University’s digital library**:
